# Getting started

Scripting is the main core mechanism of Tacticode. In order to win your fights and climb in the ladder, you need a powerful algorithm.

-----

## Javascript introduction

Scripts are written in Javascript. The goal of this game is not to teach you the ropes of programming, we expect you to be able to write code already. Do not worry though, you do not need to take any advanced programming course to play Tacticode.

What you **must** know before playing:

- Imperative programming
- Functions, variables and control structures
- How to read an API

What you **should** know before playing:

- A pathfinding algorithm (to move your character)
- A line drawing algorithm (to check the line of sight)
