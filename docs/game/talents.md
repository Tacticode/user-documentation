# Talents tree & spells

The talents tree is where you can customize your characters. Each character can allocate 30 points in this tree, excluding the starting position. You cannot allocate a point if you have not unlocked an adjacent point.

* The starting position (in red) depends on your character race. Each race has a different starting position.

* The active skills (in blue) are spells you can cast during the fight.

* The passive skills (in green) do not have to be cast, they are permanently activated during the fight.

* The statistics (in purple) increase the specified characteristic. Check the [character page](teams.md) for more information.
