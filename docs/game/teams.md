# Teams & characters

A team is a set of five characters. Each character has a race and their own AI script.

The race does not change anything except the starting position in the talent tree.

Each race can technically use any skill and specialize into any class.

## Races

* Human: A defensive and magical race. Can specialize into a Woodoo and a Priest.

* Orc: A very offensive and heavily armed race. Can become a Tank and a Warrior.

* Goblin: They like offensive magics and clever traps. Can specialize into a Mage and a Trapper.

* Elf: A sneaky race, attacking from behind or from far away. Can become a Rogue and an Archer.
